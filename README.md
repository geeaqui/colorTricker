#About The Game

The reule of the game is very simple. The player just need to choose between color green and yellow and get as much points as they can get and players can compare their scores in the score board.

I made this individual project as part of my training with SpartaGlobal within the timespan of 4days.

This is my very first game project and also because I am only beggining to learn javascript, I decided to make a very simple concept for the game.

Thank you and have fun playing :) .
