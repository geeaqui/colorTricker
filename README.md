#About The Game

The rule of the game is very simple. The player must choose between colors on the screen and get as much points as they can get, also players can compare their scores in the score board.

I made this individual project in the 4 days timespan as part of my training with SpartaGlobal. to build this project, I used my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript&JQuery.

Please note: As this is my very first time to do a game project and also because I am only beginning to learn javascript, I decided to make a very simple concept for the game.

Thank you and have fun playing :) .
